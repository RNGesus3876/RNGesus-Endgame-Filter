Your support is what makes this work possible :)

Planned features: Once in-game commands are implemented to hide and show items by tier, Tier 4 and above will be displayed for "rare" items, while Tier 5 and above will be shown for "magic" items. Additionally, unique items that hold no signifcant value even when corrupted will hidden.

This filter is designed to activate once you reach level 20 gems (approximately level 90) and no longer require Waystones (Tier 14). It preserves a natural aesthetic, unlike other filters that cause visual distortion by scaling up item text size, which can make characters appear larger and the environment feel smaller during gameplay.
